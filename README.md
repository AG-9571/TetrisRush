# TetrisRush
This repository hosts my personal rendition of the classic Tetris game, implemented entirely in Vanilla JavaScript. The aim was to create a faithful iteration of the original game, leveraging the simplicity and power of pure JavaScript, without any additional libraries or frameworks.

## Features:

- Pure JavaScript Implementation: All code is written in Vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating the capabilities and flexibility of the language without relying on external frameworks.
- Classic Gameplay: The game maintains essential Tetris mechanics, including rotations, speed levels, and scoring.
- Responsive Design: Ensures a smooth gaming experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- Commented Code: The codebase is extensively commented to aid understanding and collaboration
